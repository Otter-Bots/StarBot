# Starboard Bot
A starboard bot for Discord, that utilizes webhooks (that you can customize!) to send starboard messages.

### Commands
- /config channel <channelname> - This command allows you to configure which channel StarBot will post to.
- /config stars <amount> - This command allows you to configure the amount of stars it takes to put a message on the starboard.

### Coming Soon
 - /config webhook <webhookurl> - This command allows you to make a webhook post into the starboard instead of StarBot.
